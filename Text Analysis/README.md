Porter&#39;s Five Forces Model: Analyzes the competitive intensity and attractiveness of an
industry by examining five key forces:

1. Threat of New Entrants: How easy is it for new companies to enter the industry?
2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers: How much power do suppliers have to raise prices or
   reduce the quality of goods and services?
3. Bargaining Power of Buyers: How much power do customers have to demand lower
   prices or higher quality?
4. Threat of Substitute Products or Services: How likely are customers to switch to
   alternative products or services that meet the same need?
5. Intensity of Rivalry Among Existing Competitors: How fierce is the competition
   among current players in the industry?
   Using text data for customer reviews on products and services from secondary datasets such as
   Kaggle, an example being Flipkart Products Review Dataset
   (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mansithummar67/flipkart-product-review-dataset) or any
   other dataset of your own choice having product and/or service reviews and by making reference
   to the above Porter&#39;s Five Forces Model (where necessary), answer the following questions:
6. Describe a pipeline of tasks starting from Data Collection and ending with Insight
   Generation and Visualization. Further show Tensor flow code sample snippets for each
   activity in the pipeline.
7. With reference to the ‘Bargaining power of the Buyers’, conduct Sentiment Analysis to
   analyze customer reviews and social media for negative sentiment related to price, lack of
   features, or poor service. Show code snippets and screenshots for results for each of the
   steps in your pipeline of activities,
8. Perform Topic Modeling and Identify key mentions/topics related to either new entrants
   or competitors, disruptive technologies, alternative products or services, Pain Points or
   key areas where competition is focused (e.g., specific features, customer service aspects).
